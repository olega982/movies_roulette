✨ This is the my own pet-project based on React movies API with the Playwright E2E, Screenshot API tests,
actions, and Playwright Report.✨ <br>
<br>
To view the project:<br>
✅Clone repo on your local machine<br>
✅Install dependencies: npm install<br>
✅Start localhost: npm start<br>
✅Start Playwright tests with "npm run test:e2e"<br>
<br>
I did not implement a lot of tests here as the main idea is to show that i can build different types like e2e, API, Screenshot and integrate it into CI.
